Today on the 9th of February 2018 a lot of wordpress blogs will be updated manually by their administrators because the automatic updater was broken with version 4.9.3.

Most of the blogs and websites I host don't even use plugins or have the necessity to interact with a database.  A lot of overhead for static pages only which I can get rid of with this Jekyll blog.

Thanks to the [great introduction](http://allandenot.com/development/2015/01/11/blogging-like-a-dev-jekyll-github-prose-io.html) by Allan Denot I got started within 5 minutes.
