description: How much money does it cost to live and study at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)?
---

This post is a summary of my expenses during two years of studying at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
I collected the data with Splitwise because I am sharing expenses with my girlfriend. It contains my regular
meals at the university's canteen, my share of the rent, regular visits at a coffee-store, personal gifts,
travels and vacations. I am sure that some expenses are missing but the broad picture should be correct.

I spent a total of € 20,965.40. This corresponds to € 873.55 per month. I assume that the missing expenses won't increase
this number to more than € 900. Just for the reference, a student could apply for
a maximum BAföG of € 861 in 2020 if she or he is not living at parent's house and has to
 pay insurances. [Source](https://www.bafög.de/de/welche-bedarfssaetze-sieht-das-bafoeg-vor--375.php)

The COVID-19 pandemic does not become visible in the expenses although I could not go to
the canteen in the last seven months and did order less at restaurants etc.

The total euros spent on each category can be read from the following chart:
