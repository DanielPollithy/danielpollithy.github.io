My name is **Daniel Pollithy**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am a developer based in [Munich, Germany](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Munich/) who is going to start his M.Sc. in Computer Science in autumn.
In the meantime I am working for [blueshoe.de](https://blueshoe.de), am a board member at the [bavarian scouts](http://bayern.pfadfinden.de) and 
currently involved in [Projekt Denkende Gesellschaft](https://gesellschaftsdenken.org).
